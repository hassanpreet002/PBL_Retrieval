# Hassan_Basic-Codes
These codes are some basic coding operations for data sampling. The purpose is to understand filtering windows and fourier 
analysis in a conceptual manner through implementation.

#PBL_valuesviaTGRD_&_richardson_method
This code can be used to retrieve planetary boundary layer values from aircraft type high frequency sounding data.
